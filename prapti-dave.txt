Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
    You can't put block elements inside inline elements. Formatting. By default, inline elements do not force a new line to begin in the document flow.

    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
    In contrast, an element that is absolutely positioned is taken out of the flow; thus, other elements are positioned as if it did not exist.
    The absolutely positioned element is positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (i.e., the nearest ancestor that is not static ).

    <span>a line between the two elements.</span>
    <ul>
    <li>< a href="/html/default.asp" target="_blank">HTML</a></li>
    </ul>
